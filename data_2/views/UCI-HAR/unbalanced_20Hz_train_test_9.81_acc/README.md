# Unbalanced UCI-HAR View Resampled to 20Hz withou gravity

This view contain only the train and test files for [UCI-HAR dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones#) (70% samples train and 30% test). The data was spllited into 3s windows and was resampled to 20Hz using the [FFT method](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.resample.html#scipy.signal.resample). The accelerometer meansure is in m/sÂ² and without gravity.
